## Overview

The `sample SPL2 buttercup games` app is a basic SPL2-based app that shows how to:

* Organize your app modules for customization and reuse.
* How to specify a custom eval function.
* Specify the $SPLUNK_HOME path as a variable.
* Use a dataset literal to provide sample data for the app.
* Import an index, a lookup, and a function into the _default module.
* Use a base search to branch child searches.
* Export views.

## Compatibility, prerequisites, and requirements

This app is compatible with Splunk Enterprise.

You need a pre-release version of Splunk Enterprise that supports SPL2-based applications. See [SPL2 Public Beta overview](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/developapps/createspl2apps/spl2previewoverview) for information about the Beta.

## Installation

Complete the following steps to install a SPL2-based application:

1. On the pre-release version of Splunk Enterprise, install the `sample_spl2_buttercup_games.spl` app.
    1. Save the app on your pre-release version of Splunk Enterprise.
    2. On the Splunk Web home screen, select the **Apps** drop-down and then select **Manage apps**.
    3. Select the **Install app from file** button.
    4. Locate the app file and select **Upload**. You might be prompted to restart the Splunk Enterprise instance.

2. Verify that the app appears in the **Apps** drop-down. You can also find the app on your pre-release instance in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app_name>`folder.

## App information

This app was developed by Splunk.

### App components

| App component  | Name                      | Description            |
| :------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| App file name   | sample_spl2_buttercup_games.spl | |
| Namespace  | apps.sample_spl2_buttercup |  |
| Module    | _default | This module contains all of the searches for this app. |
| Module    | setup | This module contains the `get_metrics` function which includes a variable to specify the $SPLUNK_HOME path.
| Module    | functions | This module contains the custom eval function `prodnames`, which generates a string with the product ID and product name.
| Module    | sample_data | This module contains a dataset literal of a sample set of events. |
| View  | $successful_purchases | This view returns specific fields from the dataset literal `$data`.  The results are shown in a table in the "Buttercup Games" dashboard.  |
| View  | $products  | This view uses a lookup and returns the product names that correspond to the product IDs. For the dataset, this view uses the `successful purchases` view as a base search The `$products` view was extended in the Search Bar in Splunk Web to create the pie chart in the "Buttercup Games" dashboard.  |
| View  | $error_count | This view generates a single value count of the errors in an index and with a specific sourcetype. The results of this view are shown in the single value visualization in the "Buttercup Games" dashboard. |
| View  | $names | This view uses a custom eval function called `prodnames`. The results of this view are show in the "Products Sold" report. |
| View  | $metrics | This view uses a command function to specify $SPLUNK_HOME variable and search an internal index. The view returns specific fields from the `_internal` index. The results are shown in a table in the "Buttercup Games" dashboard.|
| Function | prodnames | This function generates a string that identifies the ID and name for each product. The function is given an alias name, prodnames_func, in the _default module. This function is in the `functions` module.|
| Function | get_metrics | This function specifies a variable for $SPLUNK_HOME and returns events from the internal `metric.log` file. The function is given an alias name, get_metrics_func, in the _default module. This function is in the `setup` module.|
| Lookup    | sample_products.csv | This lookup is used in the _default module in a view called `$products`. |
| Lookup    | sample_suppliers.csv | You can use the `sample_suppliers.csv` lookup to extend the $products view. |
| Dashboard | Buttercup Games | This dashboard contains 4 visualizations:

* A pie chart showing the products sold.
* A table listing the successful purchases.
* A single value that displays the number of errors from sourcetype = splunkd_access.
* A table showing event messages from the `metrics.log` file. |
| Report    | Products Sold | This report uses the `sample_products` lookup to display the product names of the products sold.|

## App customizations

The `get_metrics` function in the `setup` module specifies a variable for $SPLUNK_HOME and returns events from the internal "metric.log" file. This function is used in the `$metrics` view.

This function defines $SPLUNK_HOME as `$splunk_home="/Applications/SplunkBeta"`.

If necessary, change the "$splunk_home" value in the `setup` module to match your operating system. See [Manage SPL2-based apps](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/Admin/ManageSPL2apps#Manage_SPL2-based_apps) in the Splunk Enterprise *Admin Manual*.

## How to use the views in Splunk Web

You can run the views in this app in the Search Bar in Splunk Web using a specific syntax for SPL2.
The syntax is:

```| @spl2 from <view_name>```

For example:

```| @spl2 from successful_purchases```

You can refine the results from a view by extending the search.

For example, this search takes the exported view `successful_purchases` and extends the search by adding the `stats` command:

```| @spl2 from successful_purchases | stats count() BY categoryId```

For example, this search takes the exported view `products` and extends the search by adding the `buttercup_suppliers_lookup` to display the company name of the product supplier:

```| @spl2 from products | lookup buttercup_suppliers_lookup supplierId AS supplierID OUTPUTNEW supplier_name```

## Support

You can use the `#spl2` slack channel in the [splunk-usergroups Slack workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T047WPASC/C06NKCFGP5J) to post any questions or comments about this app.

Alternatively, you can email us at `spl2@splunk.com`.
